## 1. Introduction

The project aims to build a real-time weather anomaly detector using streaming data from NOAA weather sensor network. More visibility into and organization of historical real estate listing data.  I leverage Trulia's API to gather their historic data.  See Trulia's [developer page](http://developer.trulia.com/docs/read/Home) for an overview of their API.
